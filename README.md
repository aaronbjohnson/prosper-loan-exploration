# Loan Data Exploration

This is a data visualization project using loan data from prosper.com.

## Contents

**write_up.md** is a write-up of the visualization process. Here I've tracked
my design decisions both before and after receiving feedback. Here you will find
links to the public Tableau views online.

**clean_loan_data.ipynb** is the jupyter notebook I used to clean the data and
produce the final data set.

**prosperLoanData.csv** is the original data before any cleaning was performed.

**prosperLoanData_master.csv** is the final data set after the cleaning.
